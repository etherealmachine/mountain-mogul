## Tutorial Scenario: Boreal Mountain Resort

The first tutorial is based on Boreal Mountain Resort, Donner Pass, California.

| Stat | Value |
|---|---|
| Skiable area | 380 acres |
| Vertical drop | 500 ft (152 m) |
| Longest run | 1 mile (1,609 m) |
| Trails | 41 (30% green, 55% blue, 15% black) |

**Grid:** 128 x 256 cells at 10 m/cell (1,280 m E-W x 2,560 m N-S fall-line). Covers the ~1,000 m x 1,600 m Boreal footprint with buffer for base areas.

PNG loading uses stdlib `image/png`. Geo data fetching uses the `geo` package — no third-party API keys required for elevation data.

## Key Design Decisions

### Scene Stack
`engine.App` owns the scene stack (push/pop/replace). Only the top scene receives `Update` and `Render`. The `Scene` interface is defined in `engine/scene_iface.go` and re-exported from `scene/scene.go`.

Entities have no `Update()` method. The simulation drives all entity behavior explicitly by ranging over typed slices — no behavior lives on the entity structs themselves.

### Renderer
The renderer is agnostic to simulation types — it only deals in mesh IDs and instance data. Mesh IDs are constants defined in `render/mesh.go`. Static instance buffers only re-upload on scene edits; the dynamic agent buffer re-uploads every frame. Four shader programs share a flat-shading lighting model via `lighting.glsl`, prepended at load time.

`SetBrush(center Vec2, radius float32)` / `ClearBrush()` store brush state on the renderer; the terrain shader reads `uBrushCenter` and `uBrushRadius` to draw the ring analytically in the fragment shader, so it correctly follows the terrain surface.

Camera pan uses `PanDelta(screenDelta)`, which derives right/forward vectors from the camera yaw, so screen-drag direction is always consistent regardless of camera orientation. Mouse-to-terrain picking uses DDA ray-marching (`screenToCell` in `scene/scenario.go`) rather than projecting to a flat plane — required for accuracy on steep terrain.

### Terrain
Two representations: a **simulation grid** (`world.Terrain`, `Cell` structs) for pathfinding and gameplay, and a **render mesh** (heightmap quad grid) for display. Editing terrain updates vertex Y positions in the existing VBO — no full mesh rebuild required.

`Cell.TreeDensity float32` (0–1) replaces per-object tree placement. It drives three systems:
- **Rendering**: `treeCountFromDensity` derives 0–3 tree instances per cell; positions/rotations/scales are stable via a hash.
- **Pathfinding**: `Cell.Walkable()` returns `Passable && TreeDensity < 0.5` — dense forest blocks walking routes.
- **Skiing**: agents take a probabilistic collision roll (`density * dt * treeCollisionRate`) and have their speed reduced (`SkiSpeed * (1 - 0.6 * density)`) in forested cells.

Buildings and lifts still use `Passable bool` as a hard obstacle flag. Rocks, stumps, and other decorative items remain as `PlacedObject` instances (no gameplay effect).

### Geo Import
The `geo` package supports importing real-world terrain into a new scenario. `geocode.go` resolves a search string to a lat/lon bounding box, `elevation.go` fetches heightmap data for that box, `resample.go` fits it to the world grid, and `preview.go` renders a 2D overview for the `terrain_import` scene to display before the player commits.

### Agent State Machine
```
[Building] --spawn--> Walking (A* path to lift base, avoids TreeDensity >= 0.5)
                          |
                     (reach lift base)
                          |
                       Queuing
                          |
                     (front of queue)
                          |
                       Riding (progress 0->1 along lift line)
                          |
                     (progress == 1.0)
                          |
                       Skiing (straight line toward lift base)
                          |  speed = SkiSpeed * (1 - 0.6 * density)
                          |  collision roll per frame in dense cells
                          |
                     (reach lift base)
                          |
                       <loop back to Queuing>
```

Agents loop lift → ski → lift indefinitely for MVP. Skiing is straight-line at speed modulated by tree density — no gravity or friction. Walking follows A* waypoints snapped to terrain elevation.

## Rendering Pipeline (per frame)

1. **Clear** — color + depth
2. **Terrain pass** — bind `TerrainShader`, upload `uBrushCenter`/`uBrushRadius` uniforms, draw heightmap mesh; fragment shader draws brush ring analytically using world XZ interpolant `vWorldXZ`
3. **Static pass** — bind `StaticShader`; one `glDrawElementsInstanced` per mesh type (trees, rocks, stumps, buildings, towers); tree instances derived from `Cell.TreeDensity` at batch-rebuild time; buffers only re-upload on scene edits
4. **Cable pass** — bind `StaticShader` (no instancing); draw each lift's procedural cable mesh individually
5. **Dynamic pass** — bind `DynamicShader`; upload full agent instance slice every frame; single instanced draw for all agents; vertex shader derives animation from `gl_InstanceID` + `time` uniform
6. **UI pass** — disable depth test, bind `UIShader` with screen-space ortho; draw menu bar, buttons, font labels

---

## Scene Breakdown

### `StartMenu`
Renders a title + 5 buttons: **Start Game** → push `Scenario` (load `tutorial.json`); **Load Save** → hardcoded save slot; **Scenario Editor** → push `Editor`; **Settings** → stub; **Exit** → close window.

### `Scenario`
Owns `World` and `Simulation`. Menu bar: **Place Building | Place Lift | Glade | Remove**. Active tool governs left-click behavior. Glade tool uses a density brush (radius 2 cells) with a terrain-shader ring preview. Runs `Simulation.Tick(dt)` each frame. Camera: right-click drag or arrow keys to pan, scroll to zoom.

### `ScenarioEditor`
Same world view, simulation paused. Menu bar: **Plant Trees | Glade | Raise Terrain | Lower Terrain | Import Terrain | Save | Back**. Both tree tools show the terrain-shader brush ring preview. Save writes `ScenarioData` JSON to disk.

### `TerrainImport`
Allows importing real-world terrain into a new scenario. Player enters a location name or coordinates → `geo.Geocode` resolves the bounding box → `geo.FetchElevation` downloads the heightmap → `geo.Preview` renders a 2D map tile overlay → player confirms to create a new `World` from the data.

## Next Steps
- Can we use triplanar projection to improve our landscape look?
  - Main problems - we have no textures right now, do we need multiple biomes? How does snow work on top of the textured landscape?
- The lift towers need to be a T shape with two cables, the up and down cable coming out of the base, passing through the top of the T
- Then, we need chairs for the lift that we animate with skiers inside the chair, and two skiers per chair
- We also need a queuing system for the lift, so we want to track the chairs, how fast they're moving, and actually pick up and drop off pairs of skiers, with a queue of skiers "stored" in the base of the lift waiting for pick
- We need some generic pop-up windows, for example the lodge needs to be clickable to show a window with the count of skiers inside, click the lift to show skiers queued and on the lift, also need inputs so we can set lift speed
